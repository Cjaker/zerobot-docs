# ðŸ’« About BETA
Important Criteria for Features and ZeroBot in BETA

## 1) Use at Your Own Risk and Responsibility:

By choosing to use any feature or ZeroBot itself in the BETA phase, you agree that the use is at your own risk and responsibility. This version is in the testing phase, which means there may be instabilities, bugs, and unexpected problems that may affect your experience. Our team is working diligently to improve both the software and its features, but we cannot guarantee that all issues have been resolved at this early stage of testing.

## 2) Awareness of Possible Bugs/Crashes:

It's important that you are aware that bugs, crashes, and problems may occur during the BETA phase of the software/feature. Although we are doing our best to minimize these issues, the nature of the BETA phase implies the possibility of encountering these obstacles. We encourage you to report any issues you encounter so that we can address them and improve the software/feature.

## 3) Not Recommended for Use on High-Level Characters:

To avoid significant losses, we do not recommend using the software/feature in the BETA phase on high-level characters. We will be improving the stability and functionality of the software/feature, and high-level characters may be subject to additional risks. Use it carefully and consider creating test characters to minimize any negative impact.

## 4) Active Participation and Feedback:

We strongly encourage all users to actively engage in the testing process of the software/feature. Whether by experimenting with its functionality, reporting problems, or offering suggestions for improvements, your contribution is crucial to the success of ZeroBot. Your voice and feedback are valuable and help us shape the future of this software.

By continuing to use the BETA of the software/feature, you are indicating that you have read, understood, and accept the above-mentioned criteria. If you do not agree with these conditions, we recommend not using the software/feature in the BETA version.

We appreciate your understanding and collaboration as we work together to make ZeroBot even better. Your feedback is invaluable to us, and we look forward to continuing to improve this software with your help.

Sincerely,

**The ZeroBot Team**
