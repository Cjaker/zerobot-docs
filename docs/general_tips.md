# ‚≠ê General Tips

- Learn to code in Lua: [Lua online book](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html)
- To know more about a specific class, see `Documents\ZeroBot\Scripts\core\(class).lua`
- To separate your library scripts and prevent them from appearing in the ZeroBot scripts list, place them inside a folder and append _lib to the folder's name.
- To optimize script functionality, avoid using loops for repeated actions. Instead, utilize a Timer to manage these tasks more efficiently.
